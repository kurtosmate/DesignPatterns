# Design Patterns examples
This is a Demo project for the most common Design Patterns written in C#. I made it just for fun.
Every folder contains a **"Main.cs"** file which is the client of the given pattern and summarize its purpose

You can run the solution to check the behavior and the outputs of the pattern demos.
